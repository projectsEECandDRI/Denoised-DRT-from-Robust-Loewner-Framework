# Denoised-DRT-from-Robust-Loewner-Framework
This repository provides MATLAB scripts and a graphical user interface (GUI) for extracting denoised Distributions of Relaxation Times (DRTs) from noisy Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data using a data-driven method called the Robust Loewner Framework (RLF).
