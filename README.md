## üöÄOverview

The RLF algorithm builds upon the direct interpolation capabilities of the Loewner Framework (LF) while addressing its sensitivity to noise by incorporating:
* **ScreeNOT**: A robust method for selecting the optimal SVD truncation threshold that determines the optimal model order for the reduced Loewner model.
* **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-based filtering**: A post-processing step that refines the optimal model order, yielding a physically meaningful, so-called denoised DRT.

The RLF method is well-suited for frequency response analysis and system characterization, both within electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and beyond.

## üìù Algorithmic Steps for RLF-Based DRT Extraction from Impedance Data
The script **analyze_your_data_with_RLF.m** provides an efficient and user-friendly pipeline to extract a denoised DRT from your impedance data using the RLF approach. 
It performs the following main steps:
### Step 1: Import Impedance Data

- Load the frequency vector $f$ and complex impedance data $Z(f) = Z\_{real} + i Z\_{imag}$

### Step 2: Construct Loewner Matrices

- Use `Loewner_Framework.m` to compute:
  - Loewner matrix $L$, shifted Loewner matrix $Ls$
  - Interpolation vectors $V$, $W$

### Step 3: Estimate Optimal Model Order for SVD Truncation

- Use `ScreeNOT.m` (see [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for source) to determine optimal SVD truncation order $r\_{opt}$
  - Eliminates the need for manual thresholding
  - Enhances robustness to noise

### Step 4: Construct Reduced-Order State-Space Model

- Use `state_space_mod.m` to compute matrices ($E_{r\_{opt}}$, $A_{r\_{opt}}$, $B_{r\_{opt}}$, and $C_{r\_{opt}}$)
- These define the rational approximation:
  $Z_{r\_{opt}}(i\omega) = C_{r\_{opt}} (i\omega E_{r\_{opt}} - A_{r\_{opt}})^{-1} B_{r\_{opt}}$

### Step 5: Extract Discrete DRT (Unfiltered)

- Use `DRT_values.m` to compute relaxation times ($\tau_i$) and corresponding resistances ($R_i$) by performing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of $-A_{r_{\text{opt}}}^{-1} E_{r_{\text{opt}}}$
- Plotting $|R_i|$ vs. $\log_{10}(\tau_i)$ yields the discrete DRT

### Step 6: AIC-Based Filtering

- First, sort the DRT components ($R_i$ and their corresponding $\tau_i$) in descending order based on the 2-norm of their residues. This step prioritizes poles ($-1/\tau_i$) that contribute most significantly to the system response, as indicated by larger residue norms:

$${||Res_i||}_2 = {||\frac{R_i}{\tau_i}||}_2$$

- Next, apply the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) using the script `AIC_calculation.m` to identify and retain only the most essential DRT components (referred to as the Denoised DRT).
- For each model order ( $r \le r_{\text{opt}}$), compute the corrected AIC as:

$${AICc(r) = N\cdot\log\left(\frac{{RSS}_r}{N}\right) + \frac{2r(r+1)}{N - r - 1} + 2r}$$
  
- where:   
  - $r$ is the number of parameters (i.e., the model order),  
  - $N$ is the number of observations (frequency points),  
  - $RSS_r$ is the residual sum of squares for model order ($r$ ).

- Determine the refined optimal model order ($r_{\text{opt}}^*$) by either:
  - selecting the model with the lowest AICc value, or  
  - identifying the largest drop in AICc between successive model orders.

- Retain the top $r_{\text{opt}}^*$ components to obtain the denoised DRT.


### Step 7: Reconstruct Impedance from Denoised DRT

- Approximate the impedance as:

$$Z_{\text{DRT}}(i\omega) = \sum_{i=1}^{r_{\text{opt}}^*} \frac{R_i}{1 + i\omega \tau_i}$$

- Alternatively, explicitly separate the ohmic resistance ($R_0$):
  
$$Z_{\text{DRT}}(i\omega) = R_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{r_{\text{opt}}^*-1} \frac{R_i}{1 + i\omega \tau_i}$$

### Step 8: Compute Relative Residual

- Assess the reconstruction accuracy via:

$$\text{Relative Residual} = \frac{{|| Z - Z_{DRT} ||}_2}{{|| Z ||}_2} $$

### Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation

- Generate key diagnostic plots for thorough analysis:
  - **Nyquist plot**: compare measured impedance **$Z(f)$** with reconstructed impedance **$Z_{\text{DRT}}(f)$**.
  - **DRT plot**: Visualize the denoised discrete DRT (**$|\mathbf{R_i}|$** vs. **$\log_{10}(\mathbf{\tau_i})$**).
  - **Relative residuals**: Quantify the discrepancy between measured and reconstructed impedance.
  - **Singular value decay**: Examine the decay of singular values from the Loewner pencil.
  - **AICc trends**: Visually inspect the corrected AIC values to confirm the selection of the refined optimal model order ($r_{\text{opt}}^*$).
