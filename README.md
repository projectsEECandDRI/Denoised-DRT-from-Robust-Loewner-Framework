# Denoised-DRT-from-Robust-Loewner-Framework

This repository provides MATLAB scripts and a graphical user interface (GUI) for extracting denoised distribution of relaxation times (DRT) from noisy electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data using a data-driven approach called the Robust Loewner Framework (RLF).

The RLF algorithm builds upon the direct interpolation capabilities of the Loewner Framework (LF) while addressing its sensitivity to noise by incorporating:
* **ScreeNOT**: A robust method for selecting the optimal SVD truncation threshold that determines the optimal model order for the reduced Loewner model.
* **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)-based filtering**: A post-processing step that refines the optimal model order, yielding a physically meaningful, so-called denoised DRT.

The RLF method is well-suited for frequency response analysis and system characterization, both within electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and beyond.
